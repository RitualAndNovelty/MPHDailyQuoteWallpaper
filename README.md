Background Changer Python Application for Windows

Update your computer background to the quote of the day from Manly P Hall's Daily Words of Wisdom. (PDF of the quotes: https://www.prs.org/store/p431/Daily_Words_of_Wisdom_%3A_A_Calendar_of_Inspiring_Thoughts_%28e-Book%29__PDF_310-3.html)

To run the the program without looking at the code, download MPHDailyQuote.exe, newQuoteFile.txt, and LibreBodoni.ttf and click on the .exe to run the program, making sure that it's in the same folder on your device as the quote file and font file.
If you move the executable to a new folder, you need to move the text and font files with it. (I have not yet figured out how to package data with a python script, and it was not for lack of effort.)
Set up a Window's task to automatically update the background daily using Window's Task Scheduler. (How to: https://www.backup4all.com/how-to-create-a-new-task-using-windows-task-scheduler-kb.html)
